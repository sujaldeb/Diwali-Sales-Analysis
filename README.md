# Diwali Sales Analysis

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on Diwali sales data. The primary goal is to understand customer purchasing behavior during the Diwali season and derive actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

## Project Overview
The analysis focuses on demographic factors such as gender, age group, and purchasing behavior. Visualizations are created to better understand trends and patterns in the data.

### Key Insights
- **Gender Analysis**:
  - The majority of buyers are female.
  - Female buyers demonstrate a higher purchasing power compared to males.
- **Age Group Analysis**:
  - Most buyers belong to the 26-35 age group, making this segment a key target audience for future campaigns.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is `Diwali Sales Data.csv`. It contains transaction details of customers during the Diwali festival. The dataset includes:
- Customer demographics (e.g., gender, age)
- Product categories
- Purchase amounts

### Tools and Libraries
The analysis is performed using the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.

### File Structure
- **`Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, and insights.
- **`Diwali Sales Data.csv`**: The dataset used for analysis (not included in this repository; ensure to add it if sharing).
